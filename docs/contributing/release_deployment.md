# Release and Deployment

## Introduction

The handbook website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
This document provides a detailed overview of how the deployment and release
processes work, ensuring a smooth and automated workflow.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a service that allows you to host static websites directly
from your GitHub repository.

### How It Works

Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, a
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) is triggered to
automatically build and deploy the website.

You can view the build and deployment action at
[this link](https://github.com/bhklab/handbook/actions/workflows/main.yaml).

The automated workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Check Out the Repository**: The GitHub Action checks out the latest code
   from the `main` branch.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Dependencies specified in the `pixi.toml` file
   are installed.
3. **Build the Documentation**: The action builds the site using MkDocs and
   the configurations defined in your project.
4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: The compiled site is deployed to the `gh-pages`
   branch.

Once the `gh-pages` branch is updated, GitHub Pages will automatically publish
the latest version of the website.

## Releases and Versioned Documentation

We leverage both [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
and `mike` to automate the release process and manage versioned documentation,
making it easier to maintain version control, changelogs, and multiple
documentation versions.

### How Releases Work

When a pull request is merged into the `main` branch, a
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) triggers the release
process.

You can view the release automation action at
[this link](https://github.com/bhklab/handbook/actions/workflows/release-please.yaml).

Key aspects of this combined approach include:

- **Automated Release Creation with release-please**: The tool automatically
   generates a release with changelogs and updates the version number based
   on the changes merged into `main`.
- **Dynamic Pull Request Updates**: If additional changes are pushed to the
  `main` branch after a pull request is created, the release PR will update to
  include those changes, ensuring that the release captures all intended
  updates.
- **Controlled Release Process**: Maintainers can merge changes into the
  release PR only when they are ready to publish a new version, giving them
  full control over the timing of each release.
- **Versioned Documentation with mike**: Once a new release is prepared,
  `mike` is used to manage and deploy versioned documentation. This allows us
  to provide a separate set of documentation for each release, maintaining
  historical versions accessible on the website.

This automated approach ensures consistency, reduces manual effort, and allows
users to access documentation relevant to any specific version of the project.
required to manage releases.

### Manual Release Process

If you need to release a new version of the documentation manually, you can follow these steps:

1. Pull either the `main` branch or a specific release branch (e.g., `v0.1.0`) to your local machine.

=== "Releasing a `main` branch as `dev`"

      ```console
      $ git pull origin main
      From https://github.com/bhklab/handbook
      * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
      Already up to date.
      ```

=== "Release a specific version branch"

      ```console
      $ VERSION=v0.1.0
      $ git pull origin v$VERSION
      From https://github.com/bhklab/handbook
      * branch            v0.1.0     -> FETCH_HEAD
      Already up to date.
      ```

2. Use the `mike` command to deploy the documentation to the `gh-pages` branch.

=== "Releasing a `main` branch as `dev`"

      ```console
      $ pixi run mike deploy --push dev devel
      ```

=== "Release a specific version branch"

      ```console
      $ pixi run mike deploy --push --update-aliases $VERSION latest
      ```
