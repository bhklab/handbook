# [Contributing to the Lab Handbook](#contributing-to-the-lab-handbook)

*Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Lab Handbook!*

This section will guide you through the process of setting up your
development environment, installing dependencies, and building the documentation.

## Contributing Principles

The Lab Handbook is a community-driven effort, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Here are some principles we follow when reviewing and approving contributions:

### By the lab, for the lab

- Pages can be **created, edited, and reviewed** by anyone in the lab
- Every page is **understandable** by anyone in the lab
- **Maintenance and upkeep** is a responsibility shared by **everyone** in the lab

### KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid

(or Keep It Short and Simple)

- We strive to keep the handbook **focused** and **concise** to make it easy for anyone to understand
- We **avoid unnecessary complexity**

### DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

- Saves **time** and **energy**
- If details already exist on another page or website, **link to it**, don’t copy paste
- When making a page, remember it might get referred to somewhere else!
