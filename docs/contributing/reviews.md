# Reviewing a Contribution

> **Note**: This document assumes there is an open Pull Request (PR) awaiting review.

For more details, see the [GitHub Docs on Pull Requests with Required Reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews).

## Introduction

Once a contribution is submitted, a Pull Request (PR) must be created. Before merging into the main branch, the PR must undergo a review process.

### Terminology

- **Author**: The individual who submitted the contribution.
- **Reviewer**: The individual reviewing the contribution.
- **Maintainer**: The person responsible for merging the contribution after review.

## Understanding a Review

Reviews are discussions around the changes proposed in a PR. They allow for collaborative feedback, ensuring code quality and alignment with project standards.

!!! tip

    Anyone can review a PR, including those who are not maintainers!
    If you see a PR from another author, and have suggestions for improvement,
    feel free to leave a review.

For further reading, refer to the [Official GitHub Documentation on PR Reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews).

### Review Statuses

When submitting a review, you can select from three statuses:

1. **Comment**: Provide general feedback without explicitly approving or requesting changes.
2. **Approve**: Indicate that the changes are acceptable, and approve merging the PR.
3. **Request Changes**: Highlight issues that need to be addressed before the PR can be merged.

## Requesting a Review for a Pull Request

After creating a PR, you can request specific individuals or teams to review it.

- Only members of the BHK Lab organization can request reviews from other members.
