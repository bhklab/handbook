BHKLab Onboarding starts after UHN onboarding from Soleilâ€™s end. Hiring is usually project-dependent, hence new hires will have a project plan from the beginning. Once the final decision is made, projects and mentors will be emailed to you along with other details required. 

Exceptions are rotation students as we will be informed a few days before they join. In this case, the lab-coordinator (Sisira) will find a project and share it with you.
