BHKLab Onboarding starts after UHN onboarding from Soleilâ€™s end. Hiring is usually project-dependent, hence new hires will have a project plan from the beginning. Once the final decision is made, projects and mentors will be emailed to you along with other details required. 

Exceptions are rotation students as we will be informed a few days before they join. In this case, the lab-coordinator (Sisira) will find a project and share it with you.

## Upon Hiring
Once a new lab member has been hired, the following steps should be taken:

1. Add the new lab member to the [Incoming Member Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chXQ5U3NL4EZ1ALw7JxmRCmrT0W4SVTt_gT8LUfBHmQ/edit?gid=168762825#gid=168762825) sheet in the BHKLab Member Tracking sheet.
1. Determine what workspace the new lab member will be assigned to in the [Lab workspace](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LOKDkhRi4wDBf5Cg5Cjzzdeh0frhG4YZ5h11d835Qa0/edit?gid=0#gid=0) document. You may need to create a new tab to rearrange the seating. Consult with the lab coordinator about this.


## Welcome Email
Upon successful completion of UHN onboarding, Soleil will send an email (Subject: UHN Photo ID and PMCRT access card) to the new employee with details including access card and photo ID pick-up, directions etc. Following this, the lab onboarding by the assigned lab member can commence.

Respond to the email with the following template: [Email Template](bhklab_onboarding_email_template.emltpl)
