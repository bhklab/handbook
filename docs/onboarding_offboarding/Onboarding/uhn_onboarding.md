# UHN Onboarding Policy

Once you have accepted a role in the BHKLab, you will be contacted by Soleil Miron, our office coordinator. She will outline the steps you need to complete for the University Health Network onboarding procedure.

**Before your first day onsite at PMCRT** you will need to complete:

- Your background check
- The KICS Onboarding Immunization record
- The required e-learning courses
- and anything else described by UHN or Soleil.

You will be invited to a mandatory New Employee Orientation webinar on the Monday of your first week at UHN. Soleil will let you know when your UHN Photo ID and PMCRT access card are ready for pick-up. 

Once the UHN Onboarding is done, you will be connected with Katy Scott for [BHKLab Onboarding](bhklab_onboarding.md).
