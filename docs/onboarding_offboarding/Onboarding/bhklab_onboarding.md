# BHKLab Onboarding Policy

## PMCRT Lab Tour
On the first day in the lab, all new employees will be scheduled for a research onboarding by the Lab Coordinator. During the research onboarding, you will be provided an office tour of the physical and/or digital workplace. The digital office tour will include an overview of our internal research systems including: 

- [Confluence Statement of Work (SOW)](../../General/Summary_Of_Work/index.md)
- Google calendar, and the dates of [lab meetings](../../General/Meetings/lab_meeting.md) and [journal club](../../General/Meetings/journal_club.md)
- BHK Lab Slack
- [BHK Lab GitHub](https://github.com/bhklab) (added by supervisor/mentor as this is project specific)
