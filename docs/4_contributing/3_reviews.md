- Reviewer: The person who is reviewing the contribution.
- Maintainer: The person who is responsible for merging the contribution.

## What is a Review?

> Reviews are a way to discuss the changes made in a PR.
> Anyone can review a PR. Reviewers are not required to be maintainers.

### What is in a Review?

A review has three possible statuses:

1. Comment: Submit general feedback without explicitly approving the changes or requesting additional changes.
2. Approve: Submit feedback and approve merging the changes proposed in the pull request.
3. Request changes: Submit feedback that must be addressed before the pull request can be merged.

## Requesting a Pull Request Review

> After you create a pull request, you can ask a specific
> person to review the changes you've proposed.
> If you're an organization member, you can also request a
> specific team to review your changes.
