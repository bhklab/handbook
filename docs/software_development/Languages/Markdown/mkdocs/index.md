# MkDocs

MkDocs is a static site generator that uses Markdown files (and many other formats)
to create a website.

This handbook is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
These tools also have extensive documentation and guides for contributing to a Mkdocs project.

!!! note
    For a basic tutorial on Markdown, see the [Markdown page][markdown].

Funamentally, any standard Markdown file is valid for MkDocs, however, there are some
additional features that can be used to enhance the look and feel of your documentation.

## Material for MkDocs

Material for MkDocs is a theme for MkDocs that provides a modern and customizable look and feel.

It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating documentation.

Visit the [Material for MkDocs Formatting](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/formatting/) page
for more information on adding extra flavor to your Markdown files.
