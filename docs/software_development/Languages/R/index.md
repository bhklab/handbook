# R

## What is R?

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.


## Basic Resources

**Deep Dive into R**  
[Advanced R from Chapman & Hall’s R Series.](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html)  
"R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as help you to understand why R works the way it does."

**Holy Grail of Building R-Packages**  
[“R Packages” by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/)  
Very in-depth, discusses all the fundamentals of building a package and introduces useful tools (devtools, usethis)

**Brief Overview of building R-packages**  
[Mastering Software Development in R: Chapter 3 Building R Packages](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/building-r-packages.html)  
Part of a book on software development in R (highly recommend the entire book to anyone working in R)

**Bioconductor Developer Book**  
[Bioconductor Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/)  
If you are looking to build a package for Bioconductor, I heavily recommend going through these guidelines before starting as they have a rigorous approval process

**Guide to data.tables**    
[data.table in R ](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) supplemented with [External Guide to data.table](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/data-manipulation/datatable-in-r-complete-guide/) and [101 R data.table exercises](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/data-manipulation/101-r-data-table-exercises/)

## Advanced Resources

[R-Polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/r-polars/index.html) for efficiency and speed

[Tidyverse: R Packages for Data Science](https://www.tidyverse.org/) supplemented with [R for Data Science Book](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
