# Containerization

## What is Containerization?

Containerization is a technology that allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a container. This container can then be run on any machine that has the same container runtime installed.

## Why use Containerization?

- Portability
- Isolation
- Reproducibility

## Docker as an Example

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) is the most popular container platform. It lets developers:

- Build container images with all dependencies included.

- Ship these images anywhere (laptop, server, or cloud).

- Run them consistently, avoiding the “works on my machine” problem.
