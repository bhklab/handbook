# Development Environment

Think of the development environment as **EVERYTHING** that you need to
develop your project.

This includes:

- What Shell are you using?
    - `Bash`
    - `PowerShell` for most Windows users
    - `Windows Subsystem for Linux` (WSL)
    - `Zsh` (commonly installed for macOS users) but can be used on Linux!
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
    - VS Code
    - PyCharm
    - Jupyter Notebook
    - etc.
- Package Managers
    - Conda/Mamba
    - Pixi
    - Pip
    - npm
- Containerization
    - Docker
    - Singularity
- Version Control
- etc.
