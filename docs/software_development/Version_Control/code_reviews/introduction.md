# [Introduction to Code Reviews](#introduction-to-code-reviews)

Code reviews are a critical practice in software development where developers
**collaboratively examine** each otherâ€™s code to **identify issues**, **ensure adherence
 to coding standards,** and **improve overall quality** ***before*** changes are integrated
 into the main codebase.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of code reviews are to:

- **Ensure Code Quality**:

    - Identify and fix bugs early.
    - Maintain consistent coding standards.
    - Improve code readability and maintainability.

- **Facilitate Knowledge Sharing**:

    - Expose team members to different parts of the codebase.
    - Share insights on best practices and new techniques.
    - Encourage collaboration and mentoring.

- **Enhance Team Productivity**:

    - Reduce technical debt through proactive feedback.
    - Enable informed decision-making with diverse perspectives.
    - Prevent knowledge silos by decentralizing expertise.

- **Support Team Collaboration**:

    - Build trust and positive relationships among team members.
    - Encourage open communication and constructive feedback.
