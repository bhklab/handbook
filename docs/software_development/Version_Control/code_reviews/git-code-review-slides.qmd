# What are Code Reviews?

Code reviews are a critical practice in software development where developers:

- **collaboratively examine** each other’s code to **identify issues**;
- **ensure adherence to coding standards**;
- **improve overall quality** ***before*** changes are integrated into the main codebase.

## Terminology

- **Author**: The individual who submitted the contribution.
- **Reviewer**: The individual reviewing the contribution.
- **Maintainer**: The person responsible for merging the contribution after review.

# Objectives of a Code Review

## **Ensure Code Quality**

- Identify and fix bugs early.
- Maintain consistent coding standards.
- Improve code readability and maintainability.

## **Facilitate Knowledge Sharing**

- Expose team members to different parts of the codebase.
- Share insights on best practices and new techniques.
- Encourage collaboration and mentoring.

## **Enhance Team Productivity**

- Reduce technical debt through proactive feedback.
- Enable informed decision-making with diverse perspectives.
- Prevent knowledge silos by decentralizing expertise.

## **Support Team Collaboration**

- Build trust and positive relationships among team members.
- Encourage open communication and constructive feedback.
- Foster a culture of continuous improvement.

# Common Challenges in Code Reviews

## Time Constraints {.smaller}

**Problem**: Developers often feel overwhelmed with their workload, making it difficult to dedicate enough
time for thorough code reviews.  

**Impact**: Reviews may be rushed, resulting in overlooked issues and suboptimal feedback.  

. . .

**Solution**:

- Encourage small, focused pull requests to make reviews more manageable.  
- Allocate dedicated time for reviews during the workday to prioritize them effectively.  
- Use automation tools to handle repetitive checks (e.g., style or formatting issues).  

## Adversarial Dynamics {.smaller}

**Problem**: Code reviews can sometimes feel confrontational, with reviewers focusing on criticizing rather
than improving the code.  

**Impact**: Creates tension within the team and discourages collaboration.  

. . .

**Solution**:

- Promote a positive mindset by framing feedback as an opportunity for learning and improvement.  
- Encourage respectful, constructive comments that focus on the code, not the person.  
- Provide training on effective communication for both authors and reviewers.  

## Large or Complex Changes {.smaller}

**Problem**: Reviews of extensive or overly complex changes can be overwhelming and time-consuming.  

**Impact**: Leads to fatigue, reduced attention to detail, and delays in the review process.  

. . .

**Solution**:

- Request authors to split large changes into smaller, self-contained pull requests.  
- Use feature flags or staged development to integrate large changes incrementally.  

## Lack of Clear Standards {.smaller}

**Problem**: Without a defined set of coding standards, reviews can become subjective and inconsistent.  

**Impact**: Results in confusion and inefficiency, with different reviewers providing conflicting feedback.  

. . .

**Solution**:  

- Develop and document coding standards for the team, including style, architecture, and testing.  
- Leverage linters and automated tools to enforce standards consistently.  
- Regularly review and update standards to align with team goals and best practices.  

## Inadequate Feedback {.smaller}

**Problem**: Reviewers may provide vague or unhelpful comments, leaving the author unsure of how to proceed.  

**Impact**: Reduces the effectiveness of the review and prolongs the process.  

. . .

**Solution**:  

- Ensure feedback is specific, actionable, and concise.  
- Use examples or links to documentation to clarify points.  
- Balance feedback by highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement.  


# Reviewing a Contribution

## Understanding a Review

- Anyone can review a PR, including non-maintainers!
- If you see a PR from another author and have suggestions for improvement, feel free to leave a review.

## Review Statuses

When submitting a review, you can select from three statuses:

::: {.incremental}

1. **Comment**: Provide general feedback without explicitly approving or requesting changes.
2. **Approve**: Indicate that the changes are acceptable, and approve merging the PR.
3. **Request Changes**: Highlight issues that need to be addressed before the PR can be merged.

::: 

## Requesting a Review for a Pull Request

After creating a PR, you can request specific individuals or teams to review it.

- Only members of the BHK Lab organization can request reviews from other members.
