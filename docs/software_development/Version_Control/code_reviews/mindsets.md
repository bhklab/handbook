# Mindsets in Code Reviews

A successful code review process depends not just on technical knowledge but also on the right mindset.
The mindset impacts how authors and reviewers approach the process and influences the outcomes of a
code review. Let's explore the difference between a **negative mindset** and a **positive mindset**
and their effects.

## Negative Mindset

A negative mindset can turn code reviews into adversarial or unproductive experiences. This often leads
to unnecessary tension and poor outcomes for the team.

### Author's Perspective (Self-Criticism)

| **Thought**                               | **Impact**                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| "They won’t understand my work."          | Resentment toward reviewers and less clarity in code.|
| "This is just wasting my time."           | Lack of effort in preparing quality code.            |
| "They’re nitpicking my work."             | Defensive behavior and dismissing constructive feedback. |

### Reviewer's Thoughts (Criticism)

| **Thought**                                | **Impact**                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| "Another task on my plate."                | Rushed reviews with limited attention to detail.     |
| "This is my code, and they better not ruin it." | Resistance to change and collaboration.              |
| "Their work is subpar."                    | Criticism without constructive guidance.             |

## Positive Mindset

A positive mindset transforms code reviews into collaborative and enriching experiences. This creates
better outcomes for the team and the codebase.

### Author's Perspective (Self-Reflection)

| **Thought**                                 | **Impact**                                              |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| "Feedback will make my code better."        | Encourages learning and improvement.                   |
| "I should make this easy to review."        | Leads to well-prepared, clear, and concise code.        |
| "I trust my reviewers to help me improve."  | Fosters collaboration and teamwork.                    |

### Reviewer's Thoughts (Mentorship)

| **Thought**                                    | **Impact**                                              |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| "They trust me to help improve their work."    | Motivates thorough and constructive feedback.           |
| "Let’s identify opportunities for learning."   | Builds a culture of mentorship and shared knowledge.    |
| "I can learn from their approach too."         | Promotes an open exchange of ideas and perspectives.     |

By fostering a positive mindset in both authors and reviewers, teams can ensure that code reviews are
efficient, productive, and an essential tool for growth and collaboration.
