# GitHub Access

In order to use GitHub on the lab server, you will need to use an SSH key set up in your GitHub account.

First check that you [have an SSH key set up](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) on your local machine for your GitHub account. If you don't, follow the guide on [generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

You can then follow GitHub Docs' guide on [using SSH agent forwarding](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/using-ssh-agent-forwarding) to forward your SSH key to the lab server.
