# Survival Analysis

Survival analysis is a key statistical approach used to study time-to-event outcomesâ€”for example, time until disease progression, relapse, or death. Unlike traditional regression methods, survival analysis accounts for censoring (patients lost to follow-up or still alive at study end) and allows estimation of event probabilities over time.

In the **pharmacogenomics field**, survival analysis is often used to:

- Evaluate the impact of genomic biomarkers on treatment response and patient outcomes.

- Compare survival curves across patient subgroups (e.g., different mutation profiles).

- Identify predictive markers of drug benefit or toxicity.

- Build models that combine molecular, clinical, and drug-response data to guide precision medicine.

Commonly used methods include:

- **Kaplanâ€“Meier** curves: non-parametric estimates of survival probabilities over time.

- **Cox proportional hazards model**: regression framework to evaluate covariates (e.g., gene mutations, drug classes) affecting hazard rates.

- **Random survival forests / deep learning survival models**: machine learning approaches that can capture complex interactions in high-dimensional omics datasets.
