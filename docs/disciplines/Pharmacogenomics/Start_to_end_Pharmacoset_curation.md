# Start to end PSet curation guide

## This document includes all steps from sourcing dataset files you wish to curate to a PharmacoSet aka PSet.

'Prerequisites'

1. This guide is based on our R package vignette and is complimentary to the information present there. Please make sure to read the vignette [`PharmacoGx`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/PharmacoGx.html)
2. Contact lab admins (Sisira, Katy) to create a GitHub repository for curation. Name it 'dataset name_year' (eg: GDSC2_2020)

### Accessing dataset source files

#### Publicly available files

If your dataset source files (also referred to in the lab as 'raw' files), are available without restrictions, download and document the source thoroughly. For documentation, use GitHub readme.

#### For private data or data upon request
Please check the manuscript that published or mentions this dataset OR contact the first and last authors by email. Please keep Benjamin in cc.

### Storing source files

The lab MUST have a backup of all input files used for curation. You can use bhklab or radiomics H4H for storage. Guidelines listed in [High Performance Computing for Health (HPC4Health / H4H), Guide by BHKLab](https://bhklab.github.io/HPC4Health/)
### Preparing input files
