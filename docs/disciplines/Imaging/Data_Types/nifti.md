# NIfTi Format

## Introduction to NIfTI

The NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format is a
derivative of the ANALYZE format, which was originally developed for medical imaging.

### Why NIfTI?

Before NIfTI, medical imaging data was stored in a variety of formats,
 including ANALYZE, MINC, and DICOM [1].

- ANALYZE
    - ANALYZE is a proprietary format developed by the Mayo Clinic.
    - ANALYZE files are not widely supported and are often difficult to work with.
- MINC
    - MINC (Medical Image NetCDF) is a newer format developed by the National
     Institutes of Health (NIH).
    - MINC files are widely supported and can be easily shared and distributed.
- DICOM
    - DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is a standardized
     format for medical imaging data.
    - DICOM files are widely supported and can be easily shared and distributed.

## General Information

- NIfTI files will typically be stored in a single file, with the extension `.nii` or `.nii.gz`.
- NIfTI files are typically used for medical imaging data, such as MRI, CT, PET, and fMRI.
- NIfTI files are widely supported and can be easily shared and distributed.
