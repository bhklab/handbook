# Radiomics

_**Radiomics**_ is the high-throughput extraction of quantiative features from medical images for textural analysis that spatially characterises regions/volumes of interest and may provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology to support diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning [(Barry et al., 2025)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-024-11341-y#Abs1). It bridges radiology and data science, allowing for a more detailed understanding of disease characteristics.

## Learn the Foundations

- **[Intro to Python (CS50 Week 6)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/6/)**  
  Radiomics pipelines are often built in Python, so this course provides a solid foundation in the language.

- **[PyRadiomics Documentation](https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**  
  The official documentation for PyRadiomics, a robust open-source Python package for extracting engineered features from medical images.

- **[Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)**  
  A comprehensive course that covers the fundamentals of deep learning. Highly relevant for radiomics pipelines that involve neural networks for image feature extraction or outcome prediction.

- **[Lightning in 15 Minutes](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/starter/introduction.html)**  
  A concise tutorial introducing PyTorch Lightning—an efficient and reproducible way to structure deep learning projects, especially useful for radiomics model development.
