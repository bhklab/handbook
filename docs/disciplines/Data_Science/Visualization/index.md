# Data Visualization

## Overview

Data visualization is the process of representing data graphically to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. It involves selecting appropriate visual formats, designing clear and effective graphics, and ensuring that visualizations accurately reflect the underlying data. Effective data visualization helps communicate complex information in an accessible and meaningful way, supporting better analysis and decision-making.

The lab has lots of experience generating visualizations for different types of data. Feel free to ask for help with what plots suit your data best, as well as example scripts.
