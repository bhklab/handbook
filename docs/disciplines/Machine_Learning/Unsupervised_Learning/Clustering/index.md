# Clustering



The idea of clustering algorithms is to discover "hidden" groups in a dataset. Specifically it's about taking a collection of $d$-dimensional observations and partitioning the set into $K\geq 1$ groups such that the groups "make sense."


Several algorithms exist. Some of the most popular ones are

1. [K-means](./K_Means.md)
2. [Spectral Clustering](./Spectral_Clustering.md)
3. [Gaussian Mixture Models](./GMM.md)
