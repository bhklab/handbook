## **What Is Journal Club?**

Journal Club is a weekly session designed to:

- **Discuss**: Explore research papers relevant to our lab or scientific interests.
- **Analyze**: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each study.
- **Collaborate**: Share insights on how the paper could impact or inspire our work.
- **Apply**: Optionally consider incorporating the findings or methods into your projects.

It’s all about **learning**, **critiquing**, and **getting inspired**.

## **How Journal Club Works?**

- **Presenters**:
    - **Option 1**: Each presenter discusses a different paper.
    - **Option 2**: Both presenters focus on the same paper, with one highlighting its strengths and the other critiquing its weaknesses.
  
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Dumb Questioner**: A participant is randomly chosen to ask a “dumb” question, encouraging open and fun discussions.
    - **Audience Poll**: For shared papers, attendees vote on whether the positive or critical perspective was more compelling.
