## **What Is Journal Club?**  

Journal Club is a weekly session designed to:  

- **Discuss**: Explore research papers relevant to our lab or scientific interests.  
- **Analyze**: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each study.  
- **Collaborate**: Share insights on how the paper could impact or inspire our work.  
- **Apply** (optional): Consider using the methods or findings in your projects.  

It’s all about **learning**, **critiquing**, and **getting inspired**.

### **How Journal Club Works?**  

1. **Presenters**:  
    - **Option 1**: Each presenter discusses a different paper.  
    - **Option 2**: Both presenters focus on the same paper—one highlighting strengths, the other critiquing weaknesses.  

2. **Dumb Questioner**:  
    - One participant is randomly chosen to ask a “dumb” question, fostering open and fun discussions.  

3. **Audience Poll**:  
    - For shared papers, attendees vote on the stronger perspective: positive or critical.  

---

### **What Questions Should You Ask?**  

Great discussions start with thoughtful questions! Consider:  

- **Clarify**: Ask about unclear methods, results, or conclusions.  
- **Explore**: Could the findings or methods apply to our work?  
- **Challenge**: Are the methods strong enough to support the conclusions?  
- **Expand**: Suggest alternative approaches or questions the paper raises.  

---

### **Audience Role**  

Even if you’re not presenting, your participation is essential!  

- **Read the paper** beforehand, if possible.  
- **Engage**: Ask questions and share your insights.  
- **Be Open**: Every perspective adds value.

## **Resources**  

- After presenting, upload your slides to the **[JC Slides List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17j4Pzs24Vkem04yUdMgydnpDWQEGwLaPxVF7j7PFapE/edit?gid=0)** to keep our records updated.
