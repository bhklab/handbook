# The Meeting Owl

The Owl is a device that works as video and audio input for all meetings conducted in the BHK lab. It is pivotal to include the Owl in all lab meetings to bridge the gap between the users tuning in remote to the users on site.

## How to find/obtain the Owl

1. Go to Jermiah's work station (W-16).
2. Grab the key located on the bottom side of Jermiah's desk.
3. Using the key open the top drawer of the filing cabinet under Jermiah's workstation and grab the key labelled "Owl key".
4. Use this new key to open the drawer labelled 'OWL' on the filing cabinet under the right end of the whiteboards and pull out the green Owl duffle bag.

## How to use the Owl

The Owl has two major setup components. 

1. The Owl must be connected to an electrical outlet and also be connected to your computer via a USB connection. There is a USB-C dongle in the end pocket of the duffle bag for this purpose. Both wires plug into the bottom of the Owl.

2. Once the Owl is connected to power and your computer, set it down in a spot that will be able to easily see/hear everyone participating in the meeting physically. If you're hosting the meeting you also want to verify that the Owl is being used as the audio and video input to the call.
