# Lab Owl meeting Basics

The Owl is a device that works as video and audio input for all meetings conducted in the BHK lab. It is pivotal to include the Owl in all lab meetings to bridge the gap between the users tuning in remote to the users on site.

## How to find/obtain the Owl

1. Go to Jermiah's work station (W-16).
2. Grab the key located on the bottom side of Jermiah's desk.
3. Using the key open the top drawer of the filing cabinet under Jermiah's workstation and grab the key labelled "Owl key".
4. Use this new key to open the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet directly to the right of the lab/GPU server and pull out the green Owl duffle bag.

## How to use the Owl

The Owl has two major setup components. The Owl must be connected to an electrical outlet and also be connected to your computer via a USB connection.
If you have a Mac laptop you may need to use an adapter to allow direct USB connection. Once the Owl is connected to power and your computer you may set it down in a spot that will
be able to easily see/hear everyone participating in the meeting physically. If you're hosting the meeting you also want to verify that the Owl is being used as the
audio and video input to the call.
