# Project Tracking

## For the first 10-15 minutes of every lab meeting, the lab discusses the progress of the projects.

When it is your turn to present, you **must** include a copy of [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gk5uMTpn8XCMvXmoP8AWjW3x-QM0mHfPB1BfteBfqK8/edit#slide=id.g2684830fade_0_0) at the beginning of your slide deck. 
We will be using it to go through the progress of the projects.

We use four different spreadsheets to track updates. Each of them will be linked in their subsection below. 

### To Dos & Deadlines for BHK
