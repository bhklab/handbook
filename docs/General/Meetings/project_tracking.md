# Project Tracking

## For the first 10-15 minutes of every lab meeting, the lab discusses the progress of the projects.

When it is your turn to present, you **must** include a copy of [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gk5uMTpn8XCMvXmoP8AWjW3x-QM0mHfPB1BfteBfqK8/edit#slide=id.g2684830fade_0_0) at the beginning of your slide deck. 
We will be using it to go through the progress of the projects.

We use four different spreadsheets to track updates. Each of them will be linked in their subsection below. 

### To Dos & Deadlines for BHK
If there are any upcoming tasks or deadlines that you need Ben to address, [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gnfwpzSho3ePF1WhFLZC8aGuDp9IG-mM6GMHbURjy8A/edit?gid=0#gid=0) is where you add your requests.
The following are the columns in the spreadsheet:

- **Task**: Add a general descriptive title for the task.
- **Deadline**: Add the deadline for this task.
- **BHK review deadline**: Add the deadline for when you need Ben to review the task.
- **Lab Members**: The lab members involved in this task. (If it's just yourself, only write your name. If it's multiple people, write all their names.)
- **Comments**: Add any additional comments that you think are necessary.
- **Relevant links**: Add any relevant links that are necessary for this task.
