# Awards & Achivements Tracking

At BHK Lab, we encourage all members to regularly update their accomplishments. Whether you've attended a conference, received an award, or achieved any notable milestone, we want to celebrate and recognize your success! This also helps our lab administrators fill out activity reports for our lab.

Please fill out the [**BHKLab Accomplishment Tracker Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScV_5uj1dTBlhbnspCSuNNJ3oSYPSbO7yJ_PBhFvyfV6sHVAw/viewform?usp=sharing) to submit your awards and achievements. Keeping this information up to date helps highlight your contributions both within the lab and in the broader research community.

!!! note 
    This form must be filled out for each award or achievement individually.

Thank you for helping us showcase the incredible work happening at BHK Lab!
