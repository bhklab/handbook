# Cover Letter

A good cover letter can:

1. Help "sell" your manuscript to the journal editor
2. Provide a clear introduction to your work 
3. Explain why your manuscript will be of interest to the journal’s readers -- sometihng that is always a key factor for editors

As such, it is worth spending time writing a coherent and persuasive cover letter.

Write a letter that explains why the editor would want to publish your manuscript and convey a work’s importance for the editors and readers. The following structure covers all the necessary points that need to be included.

If known, address the editor who will be assessing your manuscript by their name. Include the date of submission and the journal you are submitting to.

**First paragraph**: include the title of your manuscript and the type of manuscript it is (e.g. review, research, case study). Then briefly explain the background to your study, the question you sought out to answer and why.

**Second paragraph**: you should concisely explain what was done, the main findings and why they are significant.

**Third paragraph**: here you should indicate why the readers of the journal would be interested in the work. Take your cues from the journal’s aims and scope. For example if the journal requires that all work published has broad implications explain how your study fulfills this. It is also a good idea to include a sentence on the importance of the results to the field.

**To conclude**, state the corresponding author and any journal specific requirements that need to be complied with (e.g. ethical standards).

The cover letter should also be used to highlight any potential issues such as related manuscripts currently under consideration in any other publication, as well as indicating whether you have had any prior discussions with an editor about the work described in the manuscript.

**TIP**: All cover letters should contain these sentences:

* We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.  
* All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to \[insert the name of the target journal\].

    Dear Editors,

    We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled “*Orchestrating and sharing large multimodal data for transparent and reproducible research*” as an Article in the *Nature Communications* Journal. 
    
    One of the fundamental challenges in research is ensuring that a study is fully reproducible, from data retrieval, to processing and subsequent analysis. With the continuous advances in biotechnology, including high-throughput molecular, pharmacological and radiological profiling, the intrinsic complexity of the data increased, making the computational pipelines used to process these data more intricate and difficult to replicate. Moreover, the development of new processing pipelines is allowing researchers to process the data in multiple ways, often extracting complementary information from the same assay. Importantly, with biotechnologies getting easier and cheaper to use, datasets are growing fast and are often updated, making it challenging for the community to keep track of all versions of the data. Therefore, there is a need for greater transparency, reproducibility and flexibility in the processing of large multimodal data to realize their full potential for research.
    
    To address these issues, we developed ORCESTRA ([www.orcestra.ca](http://www.orcestra.ca)), a cloud-based platform that provides a transparent, reproducible, and flexible computational framework for processing and sharing large multimodal data. The ORCESTRA platform integrates genomic, pharmacological and radiological profiles of biological samples through the orchestration of automated processing pipelines to curate customized and fully documented data objects for future analyses. Our workflows utilize a data processing and versioning tool enabling curation, standardization and flexible normalization of large multimodal data, focusing on, but not limited to, cancer research using high-throughput biotechnologies. Users can customize their data object generation by selecting different versions of a dataset and molecular profile data that is processed with multiple genomic tools, all with full transparency, as the data provenance of each data object is fully documented and objects are automatically assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
    
    We believe ORCESTRA will be a valuable contribution to the biomedical field, and will be of great interest to the readers of the *Nature Communications* journal. All authors have read and approved the final version of the manuscript. I confirm that the content of this manuscript has not been published previously and has not been submitted to another Journal. We have made our research fully reproducible by sharing all the data and documented code.   We thank you in advance for considering our manuscript for publication in the Journal.
