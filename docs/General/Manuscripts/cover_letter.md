## Cover Letter

A strong cover letter introduces your manuscript, highlights its importance, and explains why it fits the journal.

Keep it concise and aligned with the journal’s scope. Your goal is to communicate:

- What the study is about  
- Why it matters  
- Why it fits the journal and its readership  

### What to Include

- **Greeting**: Address the editor by name if known.  
- **Opening**: Date, journal name, manuscript title, and article type (e.g., research, review).  
- **Summary**: Briefly describe the research question, key methods, and main findings.  
- **Impact**: Explain how your study advances the field and aligns with the journal’s scope.  
- **Closing**: Identify the corresponding author and confirm compliance with journal policies.  

### Required Statements

- “This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.”  
- “All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to [Journal Name].”

Use the letter to confidently position your work. Editors often read it before the manuscript itself.

## Response to Reviewers

When revising a manuscript based on peer review, a well-structured response document is essential. It shows that you've addressed the feedback thoughtfully and improved the manuscript accordingly.

### Tips for Writing

- Be clear, respectful, and constructive.  
- Acknowledge valid criticisms, and explain your rationale when you disagree.  
- Reference exact changes made in the revised manuscript.

### Format

- **Reviewer comments**: Use **black text** to quote reviewer feedback.
- **Your responses**: Use **blue text** to clearly separate your reply.
- Number or bullet each comment for clarity.
- Refer to line numbers, sections, or figures in your revised manuscript wherever relevant.

### Example Structure

> **Reviewer 1 Comment:**  
> The introduction is vague about the specific hypothesis being tested.  

> **Response:**  
> Thank you for the feedback. We revised the second paragraph of the Introduction to clearly state the hypothesis: "We hypothesized that [...]." (Lines 45–50)
