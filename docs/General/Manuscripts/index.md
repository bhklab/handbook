The following document should serve as a guideline for the current and future BHK lab members in preparing their manuscripts in a fashion that enables Benjamin to read their manuscripts as quickly as possible and provide his feedback.

**Read first:**

- [Scientific Writing Tips](https://www.huber.embl.de/group/posts/writingtips.html) by Wolfgang Huber  
- [How to construct a summary paragraph](https://www.nature.com/documents/nature-summary-paragraph.pdf)  
- [How to write an abstract](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/how-to-write-an-abstract)  
- [How to write a winning cover letter](https://www.science.org/content/article/writing-winning-cover-letter)

**The following are the suggested guidelines:**

1. Create a shared Google Drive directory containing all of your supplementary information. This Drive should then be shared with BHK (bhaibeka@gmail.com) and all the other Co-authors.  
2. Add [bhklab.research@gmail.com](mailto:bhklab.research@gmail.com) as an Editor for this shared directory. Then **transfer ownership** of that directory to [bhklab.research@gmail.com](mailto:bhklab.research@gmail.com). Your directory will be stored in the “Manuscripts” folder in the [bhklab.research@gmail.com](mailto:bhklab.research@gmail.com) Google account.  
3. At the top of your manuscript have the following legend and add the following highlighting guidelines throughout your manuscript for highlighting materials:

    | Resources:        |  |
    |-------------------|--|
    | Shared Directory: | Google Drive URL |
    | Editable Figures: | Miro URL Figures |
    | Tables and Supplementary Information: | Overleaf URL |
    | Computer Code:    | GitHub URL |
    | Container:        | Code Ocean URL 
    | References:       | use Paperpile.com |
   
    ![Text highlighting colour code for mansucript writing. Blue text references figures, tables, or supplementary information; Yellow text is to be updated/modified; Red text is to be deleted; and Green text needs a reference.](img/manuscript_colour_code.png)

4. At the very top of your paper underneath the title, have the authors with superscript numbers.   
   1. The superscripts each represent the institutions the authors belong to.  
5. List the institutions that the authors belong to beneath the author  

    ???+ info "List of common collaborators"
          Here is a list of departments and institutions that the BHK lab often collaborates with or works for:  
       
          1. Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  
          2. Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  
          3. Joint Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada  
          4. Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  
          5. Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

6. For all section titles (ie Abstract, Results, etc) use Uppercase *Heading 1*.  
7. Within the above-mentioned sections if you have other titles use *Heading 2*.  
8. The regular text of the paper should be in Arial 11\.  
9. All figures should ultimately be created using [Miro](https://miro.com/).  
10. Figures, Tables and Supplementary Sections/Files should be placed in parentheses (avoid writing “Figure x shows ...” or “As can be seen in Table x …” but rather write “the results suggest … (Figure x)”)  
11. Have all your captions near your graphs for the first version of the paper.  The caption of a figure or table should always start with **one bolded sentence** summarizing its content. A figure/table caption must be sufficiently detailed to be understood on its own (ie, without reading the rest of the manuscript, aka standalone).
12. If you have small Tables you could create them in the Google Docs, however, bigger tables should be done within Google Sheet or as CSV. In general, avoid tables as much as possible, a graphic conveys messages more efficiently than many numbers.  
13. If applicable, store all of your supplementary methods, formulas, figures, tables, and supplementary info in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) while writing your manuscript*.* When your papers are at a stage ready for BHK to take a look and compile your Overleaf into a single pdf.   
    1. In order to export the figures and tables, just export the Miro charts info to overleaf  
14. Your computer code used for your project should be stored on the [BHKLAB Github repository](https://github.com/bhklab).  
15. All of your processed data and code should be stored in your CodeOcean Capsule and the code must run properly.  
16. Compile all your references in [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/). We only have limited licenses for this product, so we have to coordinate and plan to assign those licenses from one lab member to another.  
17. After a period, use single space before the new sentence (no double space).
