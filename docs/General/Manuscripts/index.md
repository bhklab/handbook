# Manuscript Writing Guidelines

The following document should serve as a guideline for the current and future BHK lab members in preparing their manuscripts in a fashion that enables Benjamin to read their manuscripts as quickly as possible and provide his feedback.

## Set Up a Shared Google Drive Folder

Create a dedicated Google Drive folder containing all supplementary materials related to your manuscript (e.g., figures, tables, raw data, code).

Share this folder with: Benjamin (bhaibeka@gmail.com)

All co-authors involved in the project.

2. Grant Editing Access and Transfer Ownership
Add bhklab.research@gmail.com as an Editor for the shared folder.

Once added, transfer ownership of the folder to bhklab.research@gmail.com.

Your folder will be organized under the “Manuscripts” directory in the bhklab.research@gmail.com Google Drive.

3. Include a Legend and Highlighting Guidelines in the Manuscript
Insert a standard legend at the very top of your manuscript.

Use the provided highlighting system consistently throughout your document to flag important sections, revisions, questions, or sections needing feedback.

(Provide the exact legend and highlighting instructions here.)


```plaintext

├──  Shared Directory: Google Drive URL
├──  Editable Figures: Miro URL
├──  Figures, Tables and Supplementary Information: Overleaf URL
├──  Computer Code: GitHub URL
├──  Container: Code Ocean URL
└──  References using Paperpile.com

Colour code while drafting the manuscript:
 <span style="color:blue"> References to figures, tables or supplementary information
 <span style="color:yellow">  To be updated/modified
 <span style="color:pink">  To be deleted
 <span style="color:green">  Reference needed

```

4. At the top of your manuscript, directly underneath the title:

List all authors, using superscript numbers to indicate their respective institutional affiliations. Each superscript number should correspond to an institution.

5. Below the author list, provide a numbered list of institutions that matches the superscripts assigned to the authors. Below is a list of departments and institutions the BHK Lab commonly collaborates with. Use these exact names when citing affiliations:

a. Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
b. Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
c. Joint Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
d. Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
e. Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
