# Guidelines for Manuscript Preparation

This guide outlines key steps for preparing a manuscript in the BHK Lab to streamline review and feedback from Benjamin and co-authors.

## 1. Initial Setup

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Create a shared Google Drive folder for all manuscript materials |
| 2 | Share it with `bhaibeka@gmail.com`, co-authors, and add `bhklab.research@gmail.com` as **Editor** |
| 3 | Transfer **ownership** to `bhklab.research@gmail.com` |
| 4 | Organize into subfolders: Figures, Tables, Supplementary, Code, etc. |

## 2. Add Legend & Highlighting Guide at the Top of Manuscript

Add the following **legend at the top** of your manuscript:

| Purpose | Style |
|--------|-------|
| Shared Directory | "[Google Drive URL]" |
| Editable Figures | "[Miro URL]" |
| Figures Tables_Supplementary_Info | "[Overleaf URL]" |
| Computer Code | "[GitHub URL]" |
| Executable Container | "[Code Ocean URL] *(optional, if applicable)*" |
| References | "[Paperpile link]" |

Then, **use these highlighting rules consistently** throughout the manuscript draft:

| Purpose | Highlight Style |
|--------|------------------|
| Figure/Table/Supplement Reference | *highlighted in blue* |
| Needs update or rewording | *highlighted in yellow* |
| To be deleted | *strikethrough in red* |
| Citation needed | *highlighted in pink* |

## 3. Manuscript Format Checklist

| Element | Requirement |

| **Tables** | Use Google Docs for small; Sheets or CSV for large |
| **Supplementary Info** | Store in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) *(optional, if applicable)*|
| **Code & Scripts** | Upload to [BHK GitHub](https://github.com/bhklab) |
| **Data** | Store and run in [Code Ocean capsule](https://codeocean.com/) *(optional, if applicable)*|
