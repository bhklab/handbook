# Manuscript Writing Guidelines

The following document should serve as a guideline for the current and future BHK lab members in preparing their manuscripts in a fashion that enables Benjamin to read their manuscripts as quickly as possible and provide his feedback.

## Set Up a Shared Google Drive Folder

Create a dedicated Google Drive folder containing all supplementary materials related to your manuscript (e.g., figures, tables, raw data, code).

Share this folder with: Benjamin (bhaibeka@gmail.com)

All co-authors involved in the project.

2. Grant Editing Access and Transfer Ownership
Add bhklab.research@gmail.com as an Editor for the shared folder.

Once added, transfer ownership of the folder to bhklab.research@gmail.com.

Your folder will be organized under the “Manuscripts” directory in the bhklab.research@gmail.com Google Drive.

3. Include a Legend and Highlighting Guidelines in the Manuscript
Insert a standard legend at the very top of your manuscript.

Use the provided highlighting system consistently throughout your document to flag important sections, revisions, questions, or sections needing feedback.

(Provide the exact legend and highlighting instructions here.)
