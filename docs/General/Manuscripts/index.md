# Manuscript Writing Guidelines

The following document should serve as a guideline for the current and future BHK lab members in preparing their manuscripts in a fashion that enables Benjamin to read their manuscripts as quickly as possible and provide his feedback.

## Set Up a Shared Google Drive Folder

Create a dedicated Google Drive folder containing all supplementary materials related to your manuscript (e.g., figures, tables, raw data, code).

Share this folder with: Benjamin (bhaibeka@gmail.com)

All co-authors involved in the project.

2. Grant Editing Access and Transfer Ownership
Add bhklab.research@gmail.com as an Editor for the shared folder.

Once added, transfer ownership of the folder to bhklab.research@gmail.com.

Your folder will be organized under the “Manuscripts” directory in the bhklab.research@gmail.com Google Drive.

3. Include a Legend and Highlighting Guidelines in the Manuscript
Insert a standard legend at the very top of your manuscript.

Use the provided highlighting system consistently throughout your document to flag important sections, revisions, questions, or sections needing feedback.

(Provide the exact legend and highlighting instructions here.)


```plaintext

├──  Shared Directory: Google Drive URL
├──  Editable Figures: Miro URL
├──  Figures, Tables and Supplementary Information: Overleaf URL
├──  Computer Code: GitHub URL
├──  Container: Code Ocean URL
└──  References using Paperpile.com

Colour code while drafting the manuscript:
 <span style="color:blue"> References to figures, tables or supplementary information
 <span style="color:yellow">  To be updated/modified
 <span style="color:pink">  To be deleted
 <span style="color:green">  Reference needed

```

4. At the top of your manuscript, directly underneath the title:

List all authors, using superscript numbers to indicate their respective institutional affiliations. Each superscript number should correspond to an institution.

5. Below the author list, provide a numbered list of institutions that matches the superscripts assigned to the authors. Below is a list of departments and institutions the BHK Lab commonly collaborates with. Use these exact names when citing affiliations:

a. Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

b. Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

c. Joint Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

d. Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

e. Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

6. Use Heading 1 (uppercase) for all main sections (e.g., Abstract, Results, etc.).

7. For any subsections within main sections, use Heading 2 formatting.

8. Regular body text should be written in Arial, font size 11.

9. Figures - All figures should be created using [Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/).

10. Refer to figures, tables, and supplementary materials in parentheses (e.g., "the results suggest... (Figure 2)"), rather than writing phrases like “Figure 2 shows…” or “As can be seen in Table 1…”.

11. Place captions directly near the figures in the initial draft.

Caption formatting:

Begin the caption with a bolded sentence summarizing the figure or table content.

Captions must be standalone — they should be understandable without needing to read the main text.

3. Tables - Small tables can be created directly in Google Docs.

Larger tables should be prepared in Google Sheets or saved as CSV files.

In general, avoid using tables when possible — use graphics instead, as they communicate information more effectively.

4. Supplementary Materials - Store all supplementary methods, formulas, figures, tables, and additional information in Overleaf while drafting your manuscript.

When your paper is ready for Benjamin's review, compile all Overleaf content into a single PDF.

Export figures and tables from Miro into Overleaf as needed.

5. Code and Data Storage
Store your project’s computer code in the [BHKLAB GitHub repository](https://github.com/bhklab).

All processed data and final code must be stored in your CodeOcean Capsule, ensuring that the code runs correctly within the environment.

6. References
Compile all references using [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/h/guide-google-docs/).

Note: Paperpile licenses are limited. Coordinate with the lab to obtain or transfer a license as needed.

7. Writing Style
After a period (.), use a single space before starting the next sentence (no double spaces).
