# Manuscript Review Presentations

This section describes the goals, format and expectations of manuscript review in the lab.

## Goal

This is to ensure the manuscript updates are discussed regularly, preferably with Benjamin attending.

**Manuscripts status can be found here - [List Ongoing Papers BHK Lab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vgoZJ7W-xOMpxllDVn6bcspOpG6yJRzXIH25gdLsk3c/edit?gid=673495392#gid=673495392&fvid=1181041881)**

## How it works

- Presenter is usually the first author. This person will be assigned in the first lab meeting of the month. This is usually based on completion status of manuscripts (usually closest to publishing goes first)
- Time the presentation so that you have at least 30 minutes for discussion
- Ensure you differentiate new updates vs. updates from your last manuscript presentation
- If multiple co-first authors are present, you can divide the results based on your individual contributions

## What to present

* Following the required structure of the manuscript you are submitting to, arrange the analysis.
