## What is the handbook?

The handbook is a collection of resources for the BHK Lab. It is intended to be a resource for all BHK Lab members to learn about the lab, its projects, and how to get involved.

{%
    include-markdown "../../README.md"
    start="<!--intro-start-->"
    end="<!--intro-end-->"
%}

If you are new to the lab, make sure you start by reviewing all pages in this section (see the left sidebar) and in the [Onboarding][onboarding] section.
