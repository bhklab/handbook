# [Summary of Work Tutorial](#summary-of-work-tutorial)

Every week, you are required to fill out a Summary of Work (SOW) document that will be reviewed by Ben. This is especially important when Ben is away from the lab, so he can stay up to date on your project progress.

This tutorial will walk you through how to set up a Google Drive SOW directory and yearly document, and how to write your weekly SOW.

## Prerequisites 

This tutorial will utilize the Google Drive associated with the [BHKLab Gmail](../Communications/bhklab_gmail.md) account that you would have set up during the [ BHKLab Onboarding](../../onboarding_offboarding/Onboarding/bhklab_onboarding.md) process. Ensure you are logged into the correct account before continuing.

If you are a short-term employee (less than one month), you may complete the instructions below with a personal Gmail account.

## Setting Up Your SOW Space
!!! note 
    This section will need to be repeated in January of each year.

### Directory Creation
In the main folders section of your Google Drive, created a directory called `SOW`. In the sharing menu, add `bhklab-admin@googlegroups.com` as an Editor. 

Within this directory, create a directory and name it the current year (e.g. `2025`).

### Document Creation
Next, open [the SOW template document](). In the File menu, select `Make a copy`. 

* Name the copy as `Your Name-SOW-Year`. (e.g. `John-SOW-2025`).
* Select the year directory you just created as the destination.

Once created, make sure the sharing permissions include `bhklab-admin@googlegroups.com`.

### Add Your Page to the Main SOW Tracker
In the [SOW Tracking Document], find your job title. Under this heading, paste the link to your SOW document and set the text to `Your Name-SOW-Year`

This is where Ben will access your SOW from weekly.

## Creating Your SOW Page

### Set up this week's tab
Open your SOW document you copied in the Document Creation section. 

1. In the document tab menu on the left hand side, duplicate an existing SOW page. 
2. Drag the duplicated tab to the top of the list.
3. Rename the tab to be the current week's dates.

### Writing Your SOW
**Date**: Set the dates at the top of the page to the first and last day of the current week (usually Monday and Friday).

**Win:** Detail work done on projects during the week.

**Needs Input:** Any questions or concerns for BHK. BHK will respond to these on Slack.

**Focus**: What you plan to work on next week.

**Important links:** Links to anything you mentioned in the above sections.

**BHK Read Marker:** For BHK use only.
