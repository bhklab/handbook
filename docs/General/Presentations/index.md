# Presentation Standards

## Talk Standards

### Key Slides

- **Title slide**: Include your name, date, affiliation, event/conference, and contact information (e.g. email). Optional: include the BHK Lab logo and others (e.g. UHN, University of Toronto, etc)
- **Acknowledgements slide**: Include names of lab members (or can reference 'BHK Lab') and other collaborators along with your institutional affilications/funding sources (e.g. UHN, CIHR, NSERC)

**Other slides**

- All slides should include slide numbers
- Slide headings should be short (1-2 lines max) and descriptive
- Use visuals whenever possible (feel free to take from existing presentations in the [database](database))


## Poster Standards

**Components**

- **Heading**: Include title, author(s) name, supervisor name (if student poster) across the top border
- **Abstract** (optional): Brief paragraph (~250 words) outlining purpose, methods, results, and conclusions
- **Introduction**: Background information pertinent to your project to help audience understand motivation. Outline the goal, objective(s), and hypothesis(es) of your research.
- **Materials and Methods**: Brief outline of materials and methods used in your work, listed clearly and logically.

- **Discussion**: Address results and describe relevance to objective(s) and hypothesis(es).
- **Conclusions**: Stated clearly and concisely, addressing project objectives and stating overall significance. 
- **References**: All references (publications)
- **Acknowledgements**: Any key lab members, collaborators, and funding sources.

**Text Sizing**

Size of lettering must be large enough to be legible from approximately 2m. Use a clear and simple font between 18 point and 30 point in size. We recommend the following for Arial:

- 18 point: best viewed at 1m (for figure titles, legends, acknowledgements, etc)
- 24 point: best viewed at 2m (for main text)
- 30 point: best viewed at 3m (for section headings)

**Suggestions**

- Avoid overloading with text, use bullet points where possible
- Whenever appropriate, use clear diagrams, figures, and table (e.g. materials and methods)
