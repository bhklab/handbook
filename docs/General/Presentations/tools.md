# Presentation Tools

This page describes standards, tools, and resources for creating presentations for the lab.

**Google Sheets**

All external presentations (conferences, workshops, external working groups), should be created on Google Sheets directly by or shared to the `bhklab.research@gmail.com` account.

Internal presentations, such as journal clubs, should also be created on Google Sheets. *Link Lab Meeting and Journal Club pages here.


**Templates**

Several slide templates have already been developed for the lab: 

- [BHKLab Internal Presentations Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GRdR3ExBVbXwgmjkHBp82i3x_mdQZPzJNHsEz1LiYWk/edit)
- [BHKLab External Presentations Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B-iTfzHvVSOD9fW80NZz14ct6HENHWOgTxU8C673TmY/edit)



**Miro**

[Miro](https://miro.com/login/) is a collaborative white board platform that enables simple diagram and multi-figure panel creation for presentations and/or manuscripts. For diagrams that will be used and updated by others in the lab, please request a Miro Board be created via the BHK Lab Miro account.


**Images and Icons**

The following are open-source biological imaging databases and platforms. The BHK Lab holds a premium Flaticon account (*do I provide login details?*). If Biorender and/or BioArt are used, please remember to add them to the acknowledgements.

**Slido**

[Slido](https://www.slido.com/) is an interactive polling platform that can be easily integrated into Google Sheets. We recommend using this platform to improve engagement in presentations, particularly workshops or other relevant use cases.
