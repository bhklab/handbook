# Presentation Tools

This page describes standards, tools, and resources for creating presentations for the lab.

## Google Slides

All external presentations (conferences, workshops, external working groups), should be created on Google Slides directly by or shared to the `bhklab.research@gmail.com` account.

Internal presentations, such as [lab meetings](../Meetings/lab_meeting.md) and [journal clubs](../Meetings/journal_club.md), should also be created on Google Slides.


## Templates  

As of December 2025, BHK lab is adapting slides to reflect the UHN rebranding. Please use this template:

## Miro 

[Miro](https://miro.com/login/) is a collaborative white board platform that enables simple diagram and multi-figure panel creation for presentations and/or manuscripts. For diagrams that will be used and updated by others in the lab, please request a Miro Board be created via the BHK Lab Miro account.
