# Presentation Tools

This page describes standards, tools, and resources for creating presentations for the lab.

**Google Sheets**

All external presentations (conferences, workshops, external working groups), should be created on Google Sheets directly by or shared to the `bhklab.research@gmail.com` account.

Internal presentations, such as journal clubs, should also be created on Google Sheets and shared to the [JC Slide List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17j4Pzs24Vkem04yUdMgydnpDWQEGwLaPxVF7j7PFapE/edit?gid=0#gid=0)


**Templates**

Several slide templates have already been developed for the lab:
