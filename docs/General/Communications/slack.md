# Slack

Daily intra-lab communications are done via [Slack](https://slack.com/). We recommend signing connecting your Slack account with your [BHKLab e-mail](./bhklab_gmail.md) as that will allow you to easily integrate with other lab tools such as the [shared calendar](./bhklab_calendar.md).


## General Rules

You are required to follow the code of conduct of your institution.
