# Slack

Daily intra-lab communications are done via [Slack](https://slack.com/). We recommend using your [BHKLab e-mail](./bhklab_gmail.md) as your Slack e-mail as that will allow you to easily integrate with other lab tools such as the [shared calendar](./bhklab_calendar.md).


## General Rules

Your communications on Slack should be professional. In particular what you post should should comply with the [Slack Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/user) as well as the code of conduct of your institution.

- [UHN Code of Conduct](https://www.uhn.ca/corporate/For_Staff/New_Employees/Documents/UHN-Policies-Codes-Handbook.pdf)
- [UofT Code of Conduct](https://people.utoronto.ca/policies/)


Being a jerk is ***strongly discouraged.*** 

Additionally, the lab Slack workspace is divided in to channels. Please use the channels for their intended purposes and following the guidelines below. 


## Channels

The Slack has four main channels - `#general`, `#random`, `#publications`, and `#conferences-workshops`. We give guidelines for posting in each of these below. The rules for posting in  `#publications` are specific and require special attention.

### General

The `#general` channel is where most lab-wide notices are posted. The content of `#general` is confined to the professional functioning of the BHK Lab and will contain things like:

- Deadline reminders (such as those for the [Summary of Work](../Summary_of_Work/index.md))
- Scientific talks that may be of interest to lab members.
- Scheduling of lab-wide events (e.g., lab retreats, hackathons, etc.)
- Group food orders.


For team-specific posting please use the proper channel (`#pharmacogenomics` or `#radiomics`). 

### Random

`#random` is, as the name suggests, a catch-all channel for content that may be of interest to the whole lab but is not related to the professional activities. Examples of the kinds of things that get posted here are:

- Links to artistic events or side projects
- Events that may be of interest (e.g., food festivals, concerts.)


### Publications

We use the `#publications` channel *exclusively* to share publications and (briefly) discuss those that are shared. Publications should in one of the following categories:

1. Papers related to ongoing BHK Lab projects.
2. Papers interest to the research areas of the BHK Lab and our collaborators. 

These categories can be interpretedly broadly. For example, if you have a computational method paper that you think could be useful for a pharmacogenomics or radiomics problem, feel free to share it. If you suspect the connection between the paper and BHK Lab research is non-obvious, you should include a comment explaining how you see a connection. Conversely, posting links to papers from [math.AG](https://arxiv.org/list/math.AG/recent), for example, without comment is unwise. 


Links to publications **must** follow the formatting guidelines below.


#### Posting to Publications

If you have a paper that you wish to share with the lab you **must** post it as a hyperlink where the text of the link is the title of the paper. Simply posting the link is *Very Not Good* and you'll be asked to fix it. 

Suppose you wanted to share [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12748). 

A proper post to `#publications` would be:


[Efficient Evolutionary Models with Digraphons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12748)

Posting  `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12748` or `Efficient Evolutionary Models with Digraphons https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12748` will result in someone (usually Ben) asking you to correct it. 

**Additional Requirements**
- If the publication you link has restricted access reply to your post *in a thread* with a pdf of the paper attached.
- If you want to comment on or discuss a paper posted by a lab member respond *in the thread*. We want to keep the channel as just a list of publications to the extent possible.


### Conferences And Workshops

The `#conferences-workshops` channel exists for posting links to upcoming conferences and workshops which might be of interest for BHK Lab Members.
