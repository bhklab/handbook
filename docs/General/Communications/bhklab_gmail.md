# BHKLab Gmail

In the BHKLab, we primarily use Google Drive for document creation, storage, and sharing and Google Calendar for all lab meeting scheduling. To improve collaboration, communication, and security, we require lab members to create a dedicated BHKLab Gmail.

This email will be used for

- All lab document handling on [Google Drive](#bhklab-google-drive)
- Sharing the [BHKLab Google calendar](#bhklab-calendar)
- Scheduling presentations for [lab meetings](../Meetings/lab_meeting.md) and [journal club meetings](../Meetings/journal_club.md)

You are also welcome to use it to create accounts for tools related to your lab work, such as [Miro](../Presentations/tools.md#presentation_tools_miro) or [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/).


## Creating your BHKLab Gmail account
Creation of this email should be done during your [BHKLab Onboarding](../../onboarding_offboarding/Onboarding/bhklab_onboarding.md) when you completed the [Onboarding Form](../../onboarding_offboarding/Onboarding/bhklab_onboarding.md#bhklab-onboarding-form), but we will describe it again here. If you have created the account already, you can skip to step 2.

1. Follow the steps described on the [Create a Gmail Account](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en) page.
    
    a. The format of your email address will be 
        
        `bhklab.firstnamelastname@gmail.com` 
    (ex. bhklab.johnsmith@gmail.com) 

2. Once you have created the account, we recommend setting up a dedicated browser profile for it. Here are instructions for setting up a profile in:

    - [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
    - [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)
    - [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/105100)

3. Your BHKLab Gmail will be added to the [BHKLab Google Accounts Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/bhklab-accounts). This will grant you access to lab-wide Google Documents.

Your BHKLab Gmail account is now ready to use!

## BHKLab Google Drive
Your BHKLab [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) is where you will store all of your lab documents. Any work related to your lab projects must be stored here.
In specific instances, documents may be shared with or from the `bhklab.research@gmail.com` account - this is one of our administrative accounts that allows us to keep track of lab documents. 

If your document needs to be shared with other lab members, you may use their BHKLab Gmail account OR the BHKLab Google Group to make the document accessible to the entire lab.

!!! warning
    Personal Gmail accounts should not be used for lab documents unless you are a short-term member of the lab (less than 1 month).

### File Sharing
If your document needs to be shared with other lab members, you may use their BHKLab Gmail account OR the BHKLab Google Group to make the document accessible to the entire lab.

To share a document with the Google Group:

1. Open the document you wish to share from your Google Drive.
2. Click the Share button in the top right corner of the document.
3. In the Add people, groups, and calendar events text box, type `bhklab-accounts@googlegroups.com` and hit enter.
4. Set the permission level as makes sense for the document.
5. Uncheck the Notify people option.
6. Click Share.
