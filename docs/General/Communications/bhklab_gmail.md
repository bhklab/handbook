# BHKLab Gmail

In the BHKLab, we primarily use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) for document creation, storage, and sharing and [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar) for all lab meeting scheduling. To improve collaboration, communication, and security, we require lab members to create a dedicated BHKLab Gmail.

This email will be used for

- All lab document handling on [Google Drive](#bhklab-google-drive)
- Sharing the [BHKLab Google calendar](#bhklab-calendar)
- Scheduling presentations for [lab meetings](../Meetings/lab_meeting.md) and [journal club meetings](../Meetings/journal_club.md)

You are also welcome to use it to create accounts for tools related to your lab work, such as [Miro][miro] or [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/).

!!! note
    Your specified preferred contact email from your onboarding will be used for the majority of communications, but lab documents and calendar events must be accessed with your BHKLab Gmail account.

When your time in the BHKLab is complete, control of the account will be transferred to the lab manager so documents can be accessed and transferred as needed.

## Creating your BHKLab Gmail account
Creation of this email should be done during your [BHKLab Onboarding](../../onboarding_offboarding/Onboarding/bhklab_onboarding.md) when you completed the [Onboarding Form](../../onboarding_offboarding/Onboarding/bhklab_onboarding.md#bhklab-onboarding-form), but we will describe it again here. If you have created the account already, you can skip to step 2.

1. Follow the steps described on the [Create a Gmail Account](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en) page.
    
    a. The format of your email address will be 
        
        bhklab.firstnamelastname@gmail.com 
    (ex. bhklab.johnsmith@gmail.com) 

2. Once you have created the account, we recommend setting up a dedicated browser profile for it. Here are instructions for setting up a profile in:

    - [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
    - [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)
    - [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/105100)

3. Your BHKLab Gmail will be added to the [BHKLab Members Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/bhklab-accounts). This will grant you access to lab-wide Google Documents.

Your BHKLab Gmail account is now ready to use!

## Integrating BHKLab Gmail with other tools
We recommend adding your BHKLab Gmail account to your regular email app or setting up email forwarding to make it easier to keep on top of shared lab documents and updates to calendar events.

### Add Gmail account to your email app
Please note, you will need to complete this process for each device you want to receive lab emails on.

- Outlook - [Quick start: Add an email account to Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/quick-start-add-an-email-account-to-outlook-e9da47c4-9b89-4b49-b945-a204aeea6726)
- Gmail - [Add another email account to the Gmail app](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6078445?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)
- Mail on Mac (Apple) - [Add email accounts in Mail on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mail/mail35803/mac)

### Set up email forwarding
Follow the steps described on the [Automatically forward Gmail messages to another account](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en) page.

## BHKLab Google Drive
Your BHKLab [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) is where you will store all of your lab documents. Any work related to your lab projects must be stored here.
In specific instances, documents may be shared with or from the `bhklab.research@gmail.com` account - this is one of our administrative accounts that allows us to keep track of lab documents. 

If your document needs to be shared with other lab members, you may use their BHKLab Gmail account OR the BHKLab Google Group to make the document accessible to the entire lab.

!!! warning
    Personal Gmail accounts should not be used for lab documents unless you are a short-term member of the lab (less than 1 month).

### File Sharing
If your document needs to be shared with other lab members, you may use their BHKLab Gmail account OR the BHKLab Google Group to make the document accessible to the entire lab. If more than three people need access to the document, we recommend sharing it with the BHKLab Members group instead.

#### To share a document with the Google Group:

1. Open the document you wish to share from your Google Drive.
2. Click the Share button in the top right corner of the document.
3. In the "Add people, groups, and calendar events" text box, enter

        bhklab-members@googlegroups.com 

4. Set the permission level as makes sense for the document.
5. Uncheck the Notify people option.
6. Click Share.

#### If you need to share multiple documents or folders:

1. In the directory menu, select all the documents and/or folders you wish to share (`Shift + Click` to select multiple).
2. Right click on the selected items and select `Share` and then `Share` again.
3. In the "Add people, groups, and calendar events" text box, enter

        bhklab-members@googlegroups.com 

4. Set the permission level as makes sense for each document. These will need to be set for each document or folder.
5. Uncheck the Notify people option.
6. Click Share.

This sharing method is useful for transferring ownership of existing lab documents on your personal Gmail account to your BHKLab Gmail account.

!!! note
    For documents and folders related to manuscripts or grants, or any other specified instance, ownership still needs to be transferred to `bhklab.research@gmail.com` in addition to sharing with the BHKLab Members group.

### Integrating your BHKLab Gmail Calendar with other tools

!!! warning
    You cannot view the BHKLAB calendar with a non-BHKLab Gmail account in the browser version of Google Calendar. Do not add any personal Gmail accounts to the BHKLAB calendar to try to do so.

- If you [added the email to Outlook](#add-gmail-account-to-your-email-app) on your Desktop, the calendar should be added automatically. Click on the Calendar icon on the far left side of the window, click the dropdown for your BHKLab Gmail account in the left panel, and toggle on the BHKLAB calendar under Other Calendars.

- If you are using the Google Calendar app on your phone, you can [add the BHKLab Gmail account](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/13322290?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) to view the BHKLAB calendar.

- If you are adding it to the Apple iCal app, open System Settings, add the BHKLab Gmail to your Internet Accounts, and make sure Calendars is toggled on. If it still isn't showing up, go to the [Google Sync Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect) and make sure BHKLAB is selected.
