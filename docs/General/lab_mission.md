# [Mission Statement](#mission-statement)

At BHK Lab, we are on a mission to revolutionize precision oncology by developing cutting-edge computational tools and predictive models. Our goal is to identify new cancer vulnerabilities and improve the delivery of precision medicine to patients.

## Research Focus

Dive into the world of pharmacogenomics and imaging analysis using the power of machine learning and deep learning. We are all about using innovative approaches to understand cancer better and find new ways to combat it.

## Our Values

- Research Transparency: We believe in open science and transparency in our work.

- Reproducibility: Our research is solid, reproducible, and ready for peer review.

- Reusability: We make sure our tools and models can be easily reused by others to advance cancer research.

## Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA)

We are committed to making science accessible to everyone. Inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility are not just buzzwords for us; they are the guiding principles of our lab.

## Lab Culture

Step into our world of collaboration and creativity! We're a diverse team from various disciplines, coming together to tackle one of the biggest challenges in medicine and we thrive on supporting each other's ideas.
