# The BHK Lab Space

The BHKLab is located in room 11-401 of the Princess Margaret Cancer Research Tower (PMCRT) in the MARS Discovery District. We share this space with other research labs under the Princess Margaret Research umbrella. Our lab space is to the left when you enter the room.

For directions to the lab, please see the BHKLab [Onboarding Policy](../onboarding_offboarding/Onboarding/bhklab_onboarding.md).

## Lab Workspace
We have four rows of workspaces available in the lab. You will be assigned a workspace during your BHKLab onboarding process.
