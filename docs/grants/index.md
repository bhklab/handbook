# Grant Submission Handbook: Tools, Guides & References

This handbook is a guide to navigating the grant submission process efficiently.
It includes a curated list of grants to consider, step-by-step instructions on how to apply, pre-submission checklists, and reusable templates to streamline the process.

Please note that each grant agency is unique in certain areas. We suggest verifying the information directly from grant websites.
