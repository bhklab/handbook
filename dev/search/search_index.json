You may choose to use only certain packages from the Tidyverse, or you may choose to only use base R and other alternatives.</p> <p>Some advantages of using the Tidyverse are:</p> <ul> <li>Consistency: All packages in the Tidyverse follow the same design     philosophy, making it easier to learn and use multiple packages. They also     mesh well with one another, making it easier to use multiple packages     together.</li> <li>Piping: Most of the Tidyverse is designed to be used together with pipes.     The <code>|&gt;</code> operator from base R &gt;=4.1 works well for this, or you can use the     <code>%&gt;%</code> pipe from the <code>magrittr</code> package for more advanced piping options.</li> <li>Readability: Often Tidyverse code is more human-readable than more complex     R alternatives, especially when using long pipe chains.</li> </ul> <p>Some disadvantages of using the Tidyverse are:</p> <ul> <li>Learning curve: The Tidyverse has a learning curve, especially if you are     new to R or programming in general. If switching over from base R, there     might also be a learning curve to relearn how to do things you are already     familiar with because of how differently things are designed.</li> <li>Stability: The Tidyverse is constantly evolving, and packages may be     updated or deprecated. While base R tries to emphasize stability across     updates, the Tidyverse packages are actively developed, and updates may     introduce changes that improve functionality but could impact existing code.</li> <li>Compatibility: The Tidyverse is not the only way to do things in R, and as     well, there are countless other packages that may not play nicely with     Tidyverse-oriented data structures or tibbles. In these cases you may have     to convert back and forth between tibbles and data frames, which can be     cumbersome.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"software_development/Languages/R/Tidyverse/#introductory-example","title":"Introductory Example","text":"<p>Say we have a CSV file containing a table, and we want to:</p> <ol> <li>Read the file into R;</li> <li>Perform some manipulations on the data; and</li> <li>Write out the new table to a different CSV file.</li> </ol> <p>First, let's define some common paths for input and output:</p> <pre><code>infile &lt;- \"rawdata/my_df.csv\"\noutfile &lt;- \"procdata/my_df.csv\"\n</code></pre> <p>Using these paths, let's compare the code for what this whole process might look like.</p> Base RTidyverse <pre><code># Read the CSV file\nmy_df &lt;- read.csv(infile)\n\n# Filter to only rows where value &gt; 10\nmy_df_filtered &lt;- my_df[my_df$value &gt; 10, ]\n\n# Select only specific columns\nmy_df_selected &lt;- my_df_filtered[, c(\"id\", \"value\")]\n\n# Write the output out to a new CSV file\nwrite.csv(my_df_selected, outfile, row.names = FALSE)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Note: You could also overwrite the <code>my_df</code> variable each time you filter rows and select columns instead of creating new intermediary data frames, especially if you have no need to keep the original or intermediary data.</li> </ul> <pre><code>my_df &lt;- infile |&gt;      # Start with the path, piping forward into the \"pipeline\"\n  read_csv() |&gt;         # From `readr`, reads a csv at the path into a tibble\n  filter(value &gt; 10) |&gt; # From `dplyr`, filters to only rows that match condition\n  select(id, value) |&gt;  # From `dplyr`, selects only specified columns by name\n  write_csv(outfile)    # From `readr`, writes the tibble to a csv file path\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Note: While technically not required, setting <code>my_df</code> to the pipeline will save the final pipeline result to that variable name. The function <code>write_csv()</code> invisibly returns the same tibble piped into it, thus it is saved as <code>my_df</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Arguably, the human-readability of the code became a bit better, even if you're not necessarily familiar with the Tidyverse. Note that the <code>read.csv()</code> function is different from the <code>read_csv()</code> function, as well as <code>write.csv()</code> and <code>write_csv()</code>.

Solution: Git's <code>log</code> command comes with many options to visualize commit history in a pretty way:</p> <pre><code>git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all\n</code></pre> <p>In the handbook, we have a dedicated branch that handles the deployment of the website called <code>gh-pages</code>. To avoid seeing this branch in your git log, you can use the following command:</p> <pre><code>git log --exclude=\"*/gh-pages\" --graph --oneline --all\n</code></pre> <p>For more information on the <code>log</code> command, see git's documentation on log.</p>"},{"location":"software_development/Version_Control/git/quick_git/#3-edit-the-last-commit","title":"3.
